                An MIS is a system that provides managers with the necessary information to make decisions
                about an organization's operations. The MIS gathers data from various sources and processes it
                to provide information tailored to the managers' and their staff's needs.While businesses use
                different types of systems, they all share one common goal: to provide managers with the
                information to make better decisions. In today's fast-paced business environment, having access
                to accurate and timely information is critical for success. MIS allows managers to track
                performance indicators, identify trends, and make informed decisions about where to allocate
                resources.
