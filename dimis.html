    <h1>Diploma in  Management Information Systems</h1>
    <p> 
        You may notice some overlap between MIS and computer science, but the two disciplines differ in one core detail: perspective. Management information systems (MIS) is the study of how people use technology to manage information. It includes both the hardware and software used to store, process, and retrieve information. Computer science is the study of how computers work. It includes the design and implementation of computer systems.
