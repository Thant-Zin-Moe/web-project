            attend work with the Company. When a student is removed from a
            course while he is on internship, the Liaison Officer has to inform

              this should be made known to UV before the internship commences.

              The student should not be required to work for more than44 hours

              If a student is ill, he must consult a registered medical
              practitioner and inform the Company Supervisor and Liaison
              Officer. He should submit the original medical certificate to the
              Company Supervisor and attach a duplicate copy to the attendance
              sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
              Leave of absence is allowed solely for official obligations and
              not for personal obligations. The student may be required to take
              leave to fulfil institutional, national or statutory obligations
              such as competitions representing nation, medical check-ups
              required by MINDEF, during internship. In such cases, the student
              is required to seek approval from his Company Supervisor and
              Liaison Officer via email with supporting documents, at least 5
              working days in advance. The student will need to attach scanned
              copies of the supporting documents to the attendance sheet to be
              sent to his Company Supervisor and Liaison Officer.

              Additional leave applied for club activities, camps, Learning
              Express, and/or inter-poly competitions will NOT be approved. For
              such reasons, the student may instead use his personal leave, if
              any is granted by the company. Otherwise, absence for such reasons
              and any other leave taken without supporting documents, will be
              considered unauthorised, or being absent without leave (AWOL), and
              may lead to disciplinary actions and failure of the internship
              module. Student should inform his Liaison Officer when taking
              personal leave is approved by the company.
            </li>
            <li>
              With effect from March 2020, during internship, 1 day AWOL is
              equivalent to 3 days of absence in the overall calculation for the
              number of working days of the internship period. This may lead to
              disciplinary actions and failure of the internship module.
            </li>
            <li>
              In order to pass the internship, the student is required to
              achieve 90% attendance of the total number of working days of the
              internship duration. If he exceeds 10% of absenteeism (including
              both authorized and unauthorized leave), the respective academic
              school may decide to fail, defer or extend the student’s
              internship duration. School Director’s approval has to be sought
              to pass a student’s internship when his attendance falls below
              90%.
            </li>
            <li>
              Company is not obliged to pay allowances for days when the student
              is absent from work , such as, but not limited to, Public Holiday,
              Public Holiday Eve, Medical Leave, Company Off Days, and Leave of
              Absence (either half or full day). Medical leave, compassionate
              leave and approved leave of absence are considered authorized
              leave. If the student is absent without authorized leave (AWOL) or
              is irregular in his attendance, please contact the Liaison Officer
              for remedial action. Students are informed to avoid applying for
              leave for personal holiday trips, club activities, camps, and
              Learning Express Programme during internship.
